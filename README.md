# scRNA_seq
My single cell RNA seq analysis for a project looking at the gene expression differences in NGLY1 mutants vs control samples. The samples were embryonics mouse brain tissues which had either no NGLY1 mutation, a homozygous NGLY1 mutation, or a heterozygous NGLY1 mutation. The code in this repository is broken into the pieces of the Suerat pipeline for analyzing scRNA seq data.
